# ONT long-read alignment with [Winnowmap](https://github.com/marbl/Winnowmap)
Once long-reads were trimmed and filtered, they were aligned to the kākāpō reference assembly (Jane's genome) for SV discovery. As with the Illumina data, reads were aligned with or without the W sex chromosome depending on the bird's sex.
```
data=/kakapo-data/ONT/
mref=/kakapo-data/References/kakapo_no_Wchromosome.fa
fref=/kakapo-data/References/kakapo_full_ref.fa
source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```
## ONT read alignment
Reads were aligned to Jane's genome using [Winnowmap v2.03](https://github.com/marbl/Winnowmap).

```
cd ${data}winnowmap

meryl count k=15 ${fref} output kakapo_full.meryl
meryl count k=15 ${mref} output kakapo_noW.meryl

meryl print greater-than distinct=0.9998 kakapo_full.meryl > kakapo_full_repetitive_k15.txt
meryl print greater-than distinct=0.9998 kakapo_noW.meryl > kakapo_noW_repetitive_k15.txt
```
Alignments were run separately for males and females. To save some time, loops were set to run through each trimmed length simultaneously for each individual.
```
for male in Bill Blades Gulliver Rangi Sass Smoko
    do
    for length in {3,4,5,10}
        do
        winnowmap -W kakapo_noW_repetitive_k15.txt -ax map-ont ${mref} ${data}trimmed/${male}_q10_${length}kbtrim.fastq.gz > ${data}winnowmap/alignment/sam/${male}_${length}kb.sam &
    done
    wait
done &
for female in Bella Kuia Margaret-Maree Sue
    do
    for length in {3,4,5,10}
        do
        winnowmap -W kakapo_full_repetitive_k15.txt -ax map-ont ${fref} ${data}trimmed/${female}_q10_${length}kbtrim.fastq.gz > ${data}winnowmap/alignment/sam/${female}_${length}kb.sam &
    done
    wait
done
wait
```
Then SAM files were sorted and converted to BAM format as per below.
```
for sam in ${data}winnowmap/alignment/sam/*.sam
    do
    base=$(basename $sam .sam)
    if [[ $base == *(Bella|Kuia|Margaret-Maree|Sue)* ]]
        then
            echo "Converting sam to bam for $base..."
            samtools view -@64 -T ${fref} -b $sam | samtools sort -@ 64 -o ${data}winnowmap/alignment/bam/${base}.bam
        else
            echo "Converting sam to bam for $base..."
            samtools view -@64 -T ${mref} -b $sam | samtools sort -@ 64 -o ${data}winnowmap/alignment/bam/${base}.bam
    fi
done
```
## Read Mapping Quality
Depths were estimated using [Mosdepth v0.3.3](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth) and [Qualimap v2.2.2](http://qualimap.conesalab.org/). Summaries were visualised using [MultiQC v1.9](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC).

For future inclusion, samples had to have a coverage of >=4x.
```
for bam in ${data}winnowmap/alignment/bam/*.bam
    do
    indiv=$(basename $bam .bam)
    echo "Running Qualimap for ${indiv}..."
    qualimap bamqc \
        -bam ${bam} \
        -nw 10000 \
        -nt 16 -c \
        -outdir ${data}winnowmap/alignment/stats/${indiv}.graphmap \
        --java-mem-size=8G &
    echo "Running mosdepth for $indiv"
    mosdepth --threads 24 --fast-mode --by 50 ${data}winnowmap/alignment/stats/$indiv $bam
done
multiqc ${data}winnowmap/alignment/stats

```
After review of the plots generated by mosdepth, A and K fell below the minimum depth thresholds and were removed from future analyses.
